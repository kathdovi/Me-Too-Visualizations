# intersectionalisee
A data visualization app that allows users to visualize the ways pressing issues affect different intersections of the population.

## Inspiration:
I wanted to try out data visualization, and I was originally inspired by the me too movement. I wanted to visualize the fact that so many communities that are not listened to are often the ones that face the most problems and should be listened to the most. After I implemented the sexual assault stats, I was inspired to find more categories to display the same theme.

## What it does:
intersectionalisee allows you to visualize the ways things such as sexual assault, poverty, unemployment, and incarceration affect different intersections of our population. The user clicks on a topic they'd like to explore and then is able to compare two different intersectional populations and see the different rates that the topic affects these demographics. The difference is then calculated for the user after they choose two intersectional populations to compare.

## How I built it:
create-react-app, Darude –– Sandstorm on repeat from the hours of midnight to 4am, lots of caffeine. I used git for version control and deployed onto Heroku. Also, Webpack broke for awhile there, which almost lead to a nervous breakdown.

## Challenges I ran into:
Okay, domain.com & heroku are currently ruining my life. Google domains is so much easier. Also I spent hours reading docs for D3, experimenting, trying out libraries with D3, failing, and trying something else afterwards. Additionally, Webpack broke for awhile there, which almost lead to a nervous breakdown.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
I made this entire project by myself start to finish. I'm proud of that! I didn't know if I would end up finishing an MVP and I was able to add a lot more on than I thought I'd be able to -- originally, this was just going to be for visualizing sexual assault statistics, but then I was able to add on poverty, unemployment, and incarceration (for the latter, I had to calculate the percentages myself with the raw numbers I found). This was the first solo project that I was able to finish and am ready to demo at a hackathon, so I'm thrilled by that. Also I'm proud of the fact that I didn't have a heart attack after all the caffeine I consumed.

## What I learned:
So much more about React.js (like state + props, which always confused me before), reading documentation still isn't great, Python is better for dataviz anyway, I shouldn't consume so much caffeine, using a custom domain on Heroku is difficult

## What's next:
More topics, more demographics, less binary if data sets will allow (but I searched data set after data set and consistently had the problem of finding binary gender data). I also would love to implement more intersections such as sexuality.

## Built with:
React.js, love, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, mermaid magic, helpful libraries like ReactChartkick after spending way too much time going down useless roads with D3.js
